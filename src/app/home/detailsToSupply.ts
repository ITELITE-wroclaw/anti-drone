          Using these 2 antennas, you can build a drone jammer system covering different sectors for bands 433MHz to 1.3GHz (PAT0413G5) and from 2.4GHz to 6GHz (PAT2450G10).
          antenna is vertically polarized.

        p2: `
          The PAT0413G5 gain is in the range of 3.4 – 8.7dBi.
          On the other hand, the PAT2450G10 gain is 9-10 dBi.
          This C-UAV antenna is designed for covering a wide range of frequencies with consistency in gain and beamwidth and providing 360 degrees of coverage. 
          The system is divided into 4 quadrants, each quadrant containing a vertically polarized antenna, covering 433MHz to 6GHz.
